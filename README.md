# Sundae DOOM

This is a collection of on-chain validators for the Hydra DOOM project. This repository is a work in progress and will continue to be updated.


## movement-validator
The movement validator was a basic proof-of-concept aiken validator to introduce how we may store game state on chain and validate state transitions. It was not planned to be included in any final implementation, but instead to think out some basic concepts.

## walking-skeleton
This is the on-chain code for the walking skeleton of the Hydra DOOM project. Work in progress.
